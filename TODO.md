# TODO

- [ ] Complete rewrite with actually good error handling this time
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Releases script
- [ ] Conform to conventional commits
- [x] Add configure and make makefile more standard
- [ ] Have something for USLT and SLST id3 tag frames?
    - Would open another terminal window and display centered lyrics
- [ ] Move as much of tuun.sh's logic into tuun itself
    - This would, for instance, allow viewing the version or help output while
      another instance is running

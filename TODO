# Project: Tuun

TODO

    Documentation!!!

    Add a dist.sh script to create a binary dist tarball

    Add configure, Makefile prefix should default to /usr/local

WIP

DONEISH

    Write a function to attempt to refresh the discord IPC connection on fails

    Maybe make discord IPC wait till 5 seconds into a song if you skip more than
    like 3 songs in a row because it currently plays catch up lol

    Vendor rustfm_scrobble
        Fork it, update stuff to whisk away the security vulnerabilities, fix any resulting issues

    Outsource global hotkey management and set up a socket instead
        Just use mpv's socket

    Add a utility, call it tm, for adding arbitrary metadata
        (ideally open all the fields in $EDITOR and allow editing)
        (currently separate from tuun; might publish eventually)

    Make the colors configurable

    Make recent_length actually accurate
        just don't subtract 1 lol

    Make now_playing LastFM thing happen after like 5 seconds of the song playing

    Allow the scrobble percentage to be configurable

    Switch from winit to rdev

    Give an error message when the playlist file doesn't exist instead of just hanging

    Add a field Vol that tracks mpv volume
        Add a (mute) indicator following it

    Add a (loop) indicator following the Prg field

    Fix crash with [general] commented out in the config

    Merge this branch with master

    Drop dirs dependency

    Support launching from quu.sh

    Loop support

    Config.toml

    Support queueing playlists and launching with a specific one
        A bit fucky though

    Use configure and makefiles
        Configure could be used to abstract rust features
        And it would ease installation

DROPPED

    Add a debug feature but otherwise disable verbose output
        Used tracing instead

    Add a field Img containing the link to the album cover
        I don't like how it looks but I might add it back later

    Integrate with mpd
        I lowkey don't like mpd, so this is not planned

IDEAS

    LRCLIB integration
        Only do this for mp3s
        I'm thinking check if lyrics exist as a metadata field (USLT and SLST with id3)
        If they don't exist, request the lyrics and save them to the relevant field(s)
        Have another terminal window open up and display the lyrics (centered)

    Allow field configuration in config.toml
